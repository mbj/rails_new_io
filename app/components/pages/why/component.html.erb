  The same command that used to be every Rails dev’s favorite has become a
  source of angst and developer fatigue. How did we get here, and more
  importantly, how should we fix it?

    It might seem like a trivial issue (‘just slap on an extra parameter
  —-minimal’) so why the fuss?

    Well, if you start thinking about a generic solution that would benefit
  the community at large (newbies and veterans alike), you’ll soon realize
  that it’s necessarily going to be surprisingly complex and nuanced:
  </p> 
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    1) it’s difficult to agree even on the most basic terms. ‘simplistic’,
  ‘everyday’, ‘circa-2007’, ‘used for most apps’ means something else for
  everyone.
  </p> 
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    2) even once that’s clarified, there's plenty of implementational
  complexity. Command line flags (which? how many? how should they work?) or
  interactive mode (choosing the bits and pieces that should be generated)
  or something else?
  </p> 
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    railsnew.io falls into the ‘something else’ category: it’s a web app to
  <span class="italic">generate the command line</span>. Once it’s
  generated, you just need to copy'n'paste and run it. No need for further
  customization, extra flags or interactive mode: the generated command line
  captures <span class="italic">everything you want your app to be</span>.

    It might sound backwards to visit a webpage in order to accomplish an
    inherently command line-based task, so here are some benefits to consider:
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    1. Avoiding 'buying a latte in a hipster coffee shop' syndrome: sometimes
    you just want a latte, and you don't know/care what to pick
    <span class="italic">exactly</span>: 0.5%/1%/2%/3% milk?
    soy/almond/rice/tapioca/buffalo/yak? bio/organic/vegan/fair trade?
    hazelnut/toffee/organic pine nut/red-velvet-sorbet syrup? half-caff,
    doppio, poured over brewed coffee, dipped, iced, stirred but not shaken?
    JUST GIVE ME MY FUCKING LATTE ALREADY. Please?!<br>
    But the questions just keep coming relentlessly! This is fine if you are a
    coffee aficionado, but if you are ordering your first latte, you might
    want to take your time and understand your options.

  </p> 
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    2. Verifying your setup. Follow detailed instructions to feel confident
    that the railsbytes you added (Stimulus, Strimulus Reflex, Tailwind,
    Bootstrap etc.) work by generating a controller and checking the view
    (using the generated stuff). The instructions are tailored to the stack
    you just set up!
  </p> 
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    3. Storing and re-using your favorite `rails new` command lines (COMING
    SOON). Perhaps minimalistic (whatever that means to YOU), stimulus-enabled
    or omakase BUT (postgres, rspec, no emails - you get the idea). Set up
    once, use anytime in the future!
  </p> 
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    4. Describing how each flag works / Linking to documentation / Displaying
    what files would be added or changed (with diffs) etc. (COMING SOON)
  </p> 
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    5. And more -
